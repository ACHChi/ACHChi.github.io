As the very first project of the curriculum, the ruby CLI project was filled with unknown explorations. Through the course of the project, I was able to learn how to make a completely new repository on github and learn the commands for saving and resuming the project. 

For the CLI project, I made a progarm that scraps data from a website called myanimelist.com where a great amount of information on different anime are sotred on there. The website is basically a wikipedia for all types of animation series. The CLI I build first greets the users and presents five options for the user to choose from. Based on the input, the program will show the titles of ten of top fifty anime. The user can then choose within the ten options for whichever anime they find interesting and furthur explore about it. The program will then show the aggregate score of the anime from the public and a short synopse about the background of the show. After the user is done with the particular anime, they can choose to explore more or exit out of the program. 

This program allows users to explore top rated animes and explore deeper on the ones they find interesting. It will show only the top fifty but since it is scraped from a live website, any changes onn the ratings will reflect in the program as well.
