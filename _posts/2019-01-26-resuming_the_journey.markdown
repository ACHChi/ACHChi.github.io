Coding is not just another language or another valuable skillset. It is a way of living. People realized that computers can do tasks faster than humans could ever achieve. As time goes by and techology advances it becomes even more obvious that software development is the core of advancement.

I first came in touch with coding when I was a sophomore at my college. A lot of my friends were computer science majors and I was an economics major. Feeling my own curiosity and their constant persuasions I singed up for some introductory computer science courses and It was eye opening. The courses showed me how fast the computer can complete tasks ranged from simple to complicated at an extraordinary speed. That human's laziness makes coding easier to learn and more peole are picking it up. It's becoming a way of living, programing is the embodiment of how to finish tasks faster with the most optimal use of logic. Unfortunately, the school policies makes switching majors almost impossible. Now I'm here, with the help of the online course, finally able to continue my journey in the world of coding.
